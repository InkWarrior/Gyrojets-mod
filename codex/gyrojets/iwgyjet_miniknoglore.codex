  	"This project has been an intriguing departure from our usual work. Gyrojet weaponry is a fascinating technology to explore, and if it weren't for all the data we stole from that human organization we might have never considered investigating it.

Since the Miniknog has no particular expectations for this technology, we have the freedom to innovate as we see fit. It's refreshing-and almost unsettling-not to encounter the usual obstacles and",

"interferences typical of a Miniknog project. Nevertheless, I intend to make the most of this opportunity.

I discovered that a large gun is not necessary for this technology to be effective; most of the work is done by the projectile itself, making a handgun sufficient. Designing an appealing and functional projectile was challenging, but I found inspiration in our novel plasma rifles with their bouncing ammunition, which led me to create something similar.",

"So far, the results are promising. I believe that the projectile's bouncing properties make it an excellent option for close-quarters combat, potentially increasing our soldiers' effectiveness against the rebels. I'll continue to explore what else can be achieved with this weapon."
