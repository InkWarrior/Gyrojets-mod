"We at ^yellow;Letheia Corporation^reset; are deeply grateful for your participation in the testing of the ^#db6036;Drilljet Experimental Rifle^reset;, Your involvement will be invaluable in advancing this ambitious project.
The ^#db6036;Drilljet Experimental Rifle^reset; is designed primarily to penetrate terrain and facilitate excavations. It features state-of-the-art drill technology combined with the latest in Gyrojet design. Additionally, the rifle includes a primary firing mode to assist the user in defending against pirates and other threats.",

"Based on the tests conducted so far, we have made the following observations and clarifications:

  ^yellow;-The Drilljet, despite being a powerful drill, gets stuck on the surface from time to time; deploying a second Drilljet close to the first one usually helps to dislodge it.^reset;

  ^orange;-The Drilljet tends to get stuck less if deployed at a diagonal angle; this is a known defect in the current Drilljet prototype and and efforts are^reset;",

"^orange;underway to make it more effective on horizontal and vertical angles.^reset;

  ^orange;-In some occasions, the Drilljet can bounce off terrain while in operation and deviate from its course; there have already many instances of Drilljets completely getting out of control, hence why you should always wear protective equipment and stay at a safe distance.^reset;

  ^red;-DO NOT POINT THE DRILLJET AT YOURSELF OR ANY OF YOUR COWORKERS.^reset;",

"Despite these observations, we can assure that the ^#db6036;Drilljet Experimental Rifle^reset; satisfies intergalactic safety regulations, and we can assure that you won't suffer major problems during testing. Have a nice day!"
