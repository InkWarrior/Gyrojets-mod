NPCs wield them and they can be dropped or found in dungeon chests.\n    [*] New animations for all the Gyrojet weapons (both new and old).\n    [*] Several sprite improvements and revamps.\n[/list]\nWell, I guess that’s it. See you sometime!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDid you know back in the sixties there were attempts to create guns that could fire rockets? Yeah! Those were the GyroJets, nowadays they aren’t produced anymore and are pretty much collection items, but, what if we add some to Starbound? Well say no more! As that what I’ve been working on!\n\nThis mod introduces 14 GyroJet assault rifles and handguns, 9 and 5 of them respectively. These have zero spread and are slightly stronger than a regular gun but at the cost of a higher energy consumption; handguns are slightly stronger than rifles but also at the cost of having a slower rate of fire. Since a lot of them are tiered, you’ll find they eventually get some upgrades, like faster and explosive ammo, being able to work underwater, having unique projectiles and weapon abilities, etc.\n\n10 of these weapons can be crafted at the anvil. 3 of them are only found on Space Anomalies and 1 can be purchased at the Treasured Trophies shop in the Outpost.\n\nIf there’s any bugs or incompatibilities make sure to post them on the discussion below.\n\n[h2] Credits [/h2]\n- [b]ComradeCorvus[/b] : for giving a lot of ideas on a better Firepower alt abilitiy and alt abilities for the RNG guns too (atleast the ones that actually made it into the mod).\n- [b]Armok[/b] : for helping me to refine the writing of the codexes and some item descriptions.\n\n[h3] Can I offer you some other mods? [/h3]\nI also have these small mods too; in case you want to look at them:\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2685213078] Risk of Rain Costumes [/url]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2694383533] Disintegration Death Animation [/url]",
